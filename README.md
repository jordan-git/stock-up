# Definitions

## Virtual Environment
Virtual environments help contain all project-specific dependencies in one place. This helps to avoid packages issues and keeps everything organized. The above commands into a terminal in the root folder will setup/activate/deactivate the project's virtual environment.

## Environment Variables
Environment variables are a way to store sensitive data outside of code files to help avoid them being shared/exposed on the internet. Using `python-dotenv` we can place any variables inside the `.env` file generated by running `setup.py` and they will work as expected in our code.
